# Cross-lingual classification of tweet sentiment

In this repository you can find the code that was used to run experiments for my diploma thesis.

The code can be split into 3 groups:
1. Obtain the data set from Twitter, clean it and merge it with the sentiment labels provided.
2. Create sentence embeddings with LASER library and build the MLP model to classify those embeddings. We run a bunch of experiments using LASER+MLP.
3. Test the classification capabilities of the cross-lingual BERT model.
